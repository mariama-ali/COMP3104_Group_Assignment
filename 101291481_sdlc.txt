We can say that the software life cycle (Software Development
 Life Cycle SDLC) is the name given to all the stages that the 
 software goes through to develop the ongoing software in both 
 production and customer use processes. Since user needs and product
  errors arise from time to time in this process, the process is never
   one-sided, but becomes a cycle where feedback is made, problems are 
   solved through repetitions, or new features are acquired. Thanks to these
    cycles, the development of the software becomes more comfortable and planned.
